name: Validate Pull Request in Production Org from main Branch
 
# Definition when the workflow should run
on:
  # The workflow will run whenever an event happens on a pull request
  pull_request:
    # The events are that a PR is opened, or when a commit is pushed
    # to a branch that has an existing pull request
    types: [opened, synchronize]
    # The branches filter allows to specify that this workflow should only
    # run if the branch name is "develop". This way we prevent this workflow
    # from running when PRs are opened on other branches
    branches: [ main ]
    # We only care about changes to the force-app directory, which is the
    # root directory of the sfdx project. This prevents the job from running
    # when changing non-salesforce files (like this yml file).
